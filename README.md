## Conventions
**Contracts** - should be Nouns <br>
**Functions** - should be Verbs <br> 
**Ables** - Smart Contracts that are meant to be inherited and not standalone, i.e. they are Mixins, Snippets, Decorators ... <br>
**Private contract scoped variables** - all start with an underscore _ <br> 
**Private / internal functions** - all start with an underscore _ <br> 
**Constructor parameters** - all start with an underscore _ and end in one too, e.g. _ens_ this is to avoid shadowing <br>
**Function parameter**s - all start with an underscore _ <br>
**Local variables** - to functions should start without an underscore <br> 
**Public contract scoped variables** - should start without an underscore <br>
**Public functions** - should start without an underscore <br> 
**Crud functions** - when there exist multiple actions on the same variable we will use the suffix to illustrate the action, for example : dailySpendLimitSet, and dailySpendLimitUpdate <br>
