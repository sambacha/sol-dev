## Conventions
Contracts - should be Nouns
Functions - should be Verbs
Ables - Smart Contracts that are meant to be inherited and not standalone, i.e. they are Mixins, Snippets, Decorators ...
Private contract scoped variables - all start with an underscore _
Private / internal functions - all start with an underscore _
Constructor parameters - all start with an underscore _ and end in one too, e.g. _ens_ this is to avoid shadowing
Function parameters - all start with an underscore _
Local variables - to functions should start without an underscore
Public contract scoped variables - should start without an underscore
Public functions - should start without an underscore
Crud functions - when there exist multiple actions on the same variable we will use the suffix to illustrate the action, for example : dailySpendLimitSet, and dailySpendLimitUpdate
